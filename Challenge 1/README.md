Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10^4 are acceptable.

Example: arr = [1,1,0,-1,-1]
there are n = 5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are 2/5 = 0.4, 2/4 = 0.4  and 1/5 = 0.2. Results are printed as:
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
